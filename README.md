# Design Patterns

> This repo is related to **Design Patterns** using Java. 
> Only the main patterns are included.

### Patterns: 
* **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. 
* **Chain of Responsibility**: Allows multiple objects to handle a request sequentially, passing it along until it's handled.
* **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations of parts of the algorithm. 
* **Decorator**: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects without modifying their classes.
* **State**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
* **Builder and Method Chaining**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing different construction processes.
* **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

* **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to decide which concrete classes to instantiate.
* **Flyweight**: Efficiently shares objects to minimize memory usage, especially for repeated objects.
* **Memento**: Captures and stores an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing undo operations.
* **Interpreter**: Provides a way to interpret languages or grammatical expressions.
